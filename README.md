# Challenge-3
Challenge 3 Javascript


In this challenge we were tasked with creating a functional button using the code we were given.

I was able to make the button function, as well as embellishing a little on the code given. 


What should happen when loading the file:

Generate Password:

Includes a slider that increases or decreases the number of characters from 1 - 128.

Includes checkboxes that will allow user to decide if they want to include the following in the password:
* Uppercase Letters
* Lowercase Letters
* Numbers
* Symbols

The Fushcia "Generate Password" button itself will change to a green/teal color upon hovering.

Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, a password will generate in the designated space, which can be copied and pasted. 

They layout is mostly where it should be, however I was unable to move the button to the bottom of the card it was on to create more space for the Password Generation area. I will most likely fix this and resubmit at a later time.
